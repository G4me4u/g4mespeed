setting.default=Default is %s.
setting.button.reset=Reset
setting.button.set=Set

setting.tps=Tickspeed
setting.betterPistons=Better Pistons

############ Client Settings ############

setting.tps.shiftPitch=Shift Sound Pitch
setting.tps.shiftPitch.desc=Modifies the pitch of sounds to match the speed at which the game is running.

setting.tps.syncTick=Synchronized Ticking
setting.tps.syncTick.desc=Synchronizes the server and client tick clock to improve piston animations. This is done by approximating the server tick-cycle.

setting.tps.syncTickAggression=Synchronization Aggression
setting.tps.syncTickAggression.desc=The aggression of synchronization. A value of 1.0 will follow the approximated clock exactly. A value of 0.0 will disable synchronization.

setting.tps.forceCarpetTickrate=Force Carpet Tickrate
setting.tps.forceCarpetTickrate.desc=Forces the client to use the tickrate set by G4mespeed and the Carpet mod. This overrides functionality related to smoothClientAnimations in Carpet. If you wish to use Carpet's handling for tickrate on the client, disable this setting.

setting.tps.showTpsLabel=Show TPS Label
setting.tps.showTpsLabel.desc=Displays a label with the current and target server tps in the top-left corner of the in-game hud. If the connected server is not a G4mespeed server the tps will be approximated.

setting.betterPistons.cullMovingBlocks=Cull Moving Blocks
setting.betterPistons.cullMovingBlocks.desc=Culls the back-face of blocks that are pushed by pistons. This will mostly affect transparent moving blocks.

setting.betterPistons.pistonAnimationType=Piston Animation Type
setting.betterPistons.pistonAnimationType.0=Pause at end
setting.betterPistons.pistonAnimationType.1=Pause at beginning
setting.betterPistons.pistonAnimationType.2=No pause
setting.betterPistons.pistonAnimationType.desc=Specifies whether to have a pause in the piston animation and if it should be at the beginning or end.

setting.betterPistons.pistonRenderDistance=Piston Render Distance
setting.betterPistons.pistonRenderDistance.desc=Render distance of blocks moved by pistons. Since this has no effect if it is greater than the block event distance on the server the option can be set to Automatic to use this distance instead.
setting.betterPistons.pistonRenderDistance.-1=Automatic
setting.betterPistons.pistonRenderDistance.1=1 chunk
setting.betterPistons.pistonRenderDistance.x=%s chunks

############ Hotkeys ############

hotkey.tps.title=Tickspeed
hotkey.tps.reset=Reset Tps
hotkey.tps.increment=Increment Tps
hotkey.tps.decrement=Decrement Tps
hotkey.tps.double=Double Tps
hotkey.tps.halve=Halve Tps

gui.hotkey.button.reset=Reset
gui.hotkey.button.cancel=Cancel

###########   Commands    ############

command.gs.info=G4mespeed version is %s

command.tps.get=Tps is %s
command.tps.set=Tps has been set to %s

command.tps.getn=Tps is %s, %sn
command.tps.geton=Tps is %s, %so %sn

###########   Server Settings    ############

setting.tps.syncPacketInterval=Synchronization Interval
setting.tps.syncPacketInterval.desc=The interval, in ticks, at which the server transmits a synchronization packet. A value of 1 allows the clients to synchronize best but also demands higher bandwidth.

setting.tps.allowHotkeys=Allow Hotkeys
setting.tps.allowHotkeys.desc=Allow hotkey controls. Disabling this will no longer allow players to change tps using in-game hotkeys.

setting.tps.broadcastTps=Broadcast TPS
setting.tps.broadcastTps.desc=Broadcasts the server tps every two seconds to allow players to accurately monitor server performance.

setting.betterPistons.blockEventDistance=Block Event Distance
setting.betterPistons.blockEventDistance.1=1 chunk
setting.betterPistons.blockEventDistance.x=%s chunks
setting.betterPistons.blockEventDistance.desc=The broadcast-radius, in chunks, for which piston block-events will be sent to clients. This will also affect the maximum view distance for moving blocks on clients.

setting.betterPistons.paranoidMode=Paranoid Mode
setting.betterPistons.paranoidMode.desc=Sends multiple redundant piston block-change packets to nearby players. This ensures that clients that were unable to execute the correct piston block-events can still synchronize properly. It is recommended to use this in conjunction with Immediate Block Broadcast.

setting.betterPistons.immediateBlockBroadcast=Immediate Block Broadcast
setting.betterPistons.immediateBlockBroadcast.desc=Broadcasts all block changes caused by major redstone-related components within the same tick as they occurred. This acts as a complement to and does not replace the broadcast that occurs at the beginning of each tick. It is recommended to use this with Paranoid Mode enabled and Block Event Distance set to 0 chunks.
