setting.tps=Tickspeed

# Client settings
setting.tps.shiftPitch=Shift sound pitch
setting.tps.shiftPitch.desc=Modifies the pitch of sounds to match the speed at which the game is running.
setting.tps.cullMovingBlocks=Cull moving blocks
setting.tps.cullMovingBlocks.desc=Culls the back-face of blocks that are pushed by pistons. This will mostly affect transparent moving blocks.

setting.tps.syncTick=Synchronized ticking
setting.tps.syncTick.desc=Synchronizes the server and client tick clock to improve piston animations. This is done by approximating the server tick-cycle.
setting.tps.syncTickAggression=Synchronization aggression
setting.tps.syncTickAggression.desc=The aggression of synchronization. A value of 1.0 will follow the approximated clock exactly. A value of 0.0 will disable synchronization.


#Server settings
setting.tps.syncPacketInterval=Synchronization interval
setting.tps.syncPacketInterval.desc=The interval, in ticks, at which the server attempts to synchronize the client tick cycle. A value of 1 allows the client to synchronize best but also demands higher bandwidth.
